[Submit a form and receive email Using Express, Nodejs, Nodemailer and MailGun - Complete Guide](https://dev.to/umekalu/submit-a-form-and-receive-email-using-express-nodejs-nodemailer-and-mailgun-complete-guide-nl1)

**Lessons Learned**
1. Code Age - Some syntax elements of Express have changed
2. Required JQuery CDN - Removed Bootstrap error by adding JQuery CDN
3. HTML JS Script - Removed $ error by adding JQuery CDN
4. Mailgun - Mailgun UI has changed but the original elements can be found
5. Router to App - Had to change "router" to "app" to solve Localhost:8080 error
6. Email Sent - The HTML UI works but does not send console log message (Bug)

**Next Steps**
1. It is possible that the Mailgun API implemenation has changed.
2. Need to consult other implementations of Express using Nodemailer
